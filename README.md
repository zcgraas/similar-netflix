> Similar-Netflix was intitially built by me to get comfortable with React. Along the way I learned a lot and ended up adding quite a few more features than I initially planned. This web app is built with a React.js front-end. I styled using SASS and the [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) library. The backend utilizes Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) platform. Data is supplied from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US) using their API.
