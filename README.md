# Looks Pretty Similar to Netflix

> Similar-Netflix was intitially built by me to get comfortable with React. Along the way I learned a lot and ended up adding quite a few more features than I initially planned. This web app is built with a React.js front-end. I styled using SASS and the [styled-components] (https://styled-components.com/) library. The backend utilizes Google's [Firebase] (https://firebase.google.com/) platform. Data is supplied from [The Movie Database] (https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US) using their API.

###### What can I do?

Most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer! Here are a few examples to get you started:

- Generate screenshots and PDFs of pages.
- Crawl a SPA (Single-Page Application) and generate pre-rendered content (i.e. "SSR" (Server-Side Rendering)).
- Automate form submission, UI testing, keyboard input, etc.
- Create an up-to-date, automated testing environment. Run your tests directly in the latest version of Chrome using the latest JavaScript and browser features.
- Capture a [timeline trace](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference) of your site to help diagnose performance issues.
- Test Chrome Extensions.
